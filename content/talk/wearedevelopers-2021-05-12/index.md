summary: Kafka, Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch, and Data Consistency 
abstract: "I'll tell a story on how we've hunted down a Heisenbug in a system that should have prevented it by design in the very first place and finally fixed it. 
The story involves Kafka, Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch, optimistic concurrency control, data inconsistencies, and SRE with plenty of good intentions that in a series of unfortunate circumstances caused a nasty bug."
